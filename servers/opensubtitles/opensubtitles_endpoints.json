All parameters can be combined following various logics: searching by a specific external id (imdb, tmdb), a file moviehash, or a simple text query.\n\n<!-- theme: warning -->\n> Something wrong? Read about [common mistakes and best practices](docs/2-Best-Practices.md). \n\n> Getting no results? Follow HTTP redirects! ```curl --location``` and use verbose mode\n\n> Use ```imdb_id for``` movie or episode. Use ```parent_imdb_id``` for TV Shows\n\n\n\nImplement the logic that best fits your needs, keeping in mind the following guidelines:\n\n- If you can obtain the moviehash from the file, please send it along.\n- If you possess the ID, whether it's IMDB or TMDB, send it instead of a query, as an ID provides more precision.\n- When searching for TV show episodes, it is recommended to send the parent ID, along with the episode and season number for optimal results.  If you have the unique ID of an episode, only send this ID, excluding the episode or season number.\n- Include the filename as a query parameter along with the moviehash for improved results. If your filenames are generally irrelevant, such as dynamically generated filenames from a streaming service, there's no need to include them.\n- Consider treating parameters as filters rather than additional criteria. If you have a specific ID and send a query with conflicting data, like a wrong year, it could result in fewer matches.\n- Explore querying the /features endpoint to gather the exact list of available episodes.\n- Keep in mind that this is a collaborative project where subtitles are submitted by users, filtered by admins, and movie/show results are processed through various APIs. Occasionally, errors may occur, and we depend on user feedback to address and rectify them.\n\n\n> Avoid http redirection by sending request parameters sorted and without default values, and send all queries in lowercase. Remove leading zeroes in ID parameters (IMDB ID, TMDB ID...)\n\n### Moviehash \nIf a ```moviehash``` is sent with a request, a ```moviehash_match``` boolean field will be added to the response.\n\nThe matching subtitles will always come first in the response.\n\n\n### Ordering\n\n<!-- theme: warning -->\n> If possible, don't order results, because sorting on server is \"expensive, time consuming operation\" and also you have much higher chance to get cached result when not using this function.\n\nYou can order the results using the ```order_by``` parameter.
